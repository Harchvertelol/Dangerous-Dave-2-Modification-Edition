-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.6 pre-beta: (May 18, 2020)

- This is the pre-beta version of the game Dangerous Dave 2: Modification Edition.
  While there is an active search for bugs and their correction.
  
- Changes:
  
  1) Added API function getStateDave ().
  2) Added two types of ghosts (beta algorithm).
  3) Added the last boss and friend of Dave.
  4) Introduced for the passage of all 8 original levels.
  5) Two new possible level parameters have been introduced.
  6) Added information to the level loading screen.
  7) Added screen to end the game.
  8) Added an additional package of levels for passing. Run using a .bat file.

- Bugs fixed:
  
  1) Fixed a serious segmentation error (and program crash).
  2) Fixed color shift bug after displaying the last message in the game.
  3) Fixed physics in the function of moving monsters in the API.
    
- Detected bugs:

  1) Go close to the wall to the left. Lower the gun down. Turn right. Click jump. Take off on the wall.
  2) Will not fall from hard tiles from recoil when shooting to the left. If you shoot up or down - it does not fall from hard tiles (it was found that in the original
     Dave also decided not to fix it yet).
  3) When caching is off, the transparency mask does not work. The reason is known until corrected.
  4) The screen follows the player too clearly. Not so in the original.
  5) There is no illumination of a monster when hit.
  6) Dave's quick switch to reload (planned to be fixed when transferring Dave's mechanics to lua).
  7) Dave does not go down the stairs as quickly as in the original (it is planned to fix it when translating Dave's mechanics into a lua).
  8) No animation in flight. Incorrect animation of the jump (must be fingered). Must hang longer at the top (planned to be fixed when transferring Dave's mechanics to lua).
  9) Running animation when abutting against the wall should stop (it is planned to fix it when transferring Dave's mechanics to lua).
  10) Fix the API. Functions goUp / goDown (add walking on the wall) and testTileDown (and the rest of them, to figure out how they should work).
  11) The animation counter is not reset when the state of the monster changes. Thought: add a global parameter for each monster, giving you the opportunity to either manually manage it yourself, or let the program automatically reset.
  12) Bonuses in the original blink randomly, but not harmoniously with each other.
  13) Sometimes the animation of entering the door may go astray.
  14) Points do not fly out of the monster. No points for a monster.

- Minuses:

  1) Bugs, bugs, bugs (already less than before, but still).
  2) ALL settings are in the .ini file.
  3) The initial screen saver is not the same as in the original Dave.

  3) Upon death, the monster was taken away the number of lives equal to the number of monsters killing Dave at the moment.
    
- Detected bugs:

  1) Go close to the wall to the left. Lower the gun down. Turn right. Click jump. Take off on the wall.
  2) Will not fall from hard tiles from recoil when shooting to the left. If you shoot up or down - it does not fall from hard tiles (it was found that in the original

Changes in version 0.4 pre-beta: (May 08, 2020)

- This is the pre-beta version of the game Dangerous Dave 2: Modification Edition.
  While there is an active search for bugs and their correction.
  
- Changes:
  
  1) Optimization of work with memory.
  2) Added FPS display function.
  3) The transition to a new version of the engine.
  4) Added transparency mask in modpacks. Also added the option to enable/disable it in DD2.ini.
  5) Updating the API. Now any function can be applied to any monster with a level, if you know its "key".
     The key so far can only be obtained by creating a duplicate of the monster. This gave incompatibility to scripts of previous versions
     with the current version of the API. Files in the original delivery have been overwritten.
  6) The ability to use a temporary image factory has been added to the API. Strongly improved spider intelligence in terms of
     performance.
  7) The functions onDamage () and onKill () appeared, which are called when the monster receives damage and the death of the monster, respectively.
     Additional API changes.
  8) Fixed a bug in the API associated with the crash of the program when moving by 0 pixels.
  9) Fixed a bug in the inner workings of the intelligence of monsters.

- Bugs fixed:
  
  1) Fixed a bug in the animation of Dave's death not at first when interrupting it in the previous game.
  2) Fixed all bugs found intelligence zombies. Including walking through the void and a bug with stairs.
    
- Detected bugs:

  1) Go close to the wall to the left. Lower the gun down. Turn right. Click jump. Take off on the wall.
  2) Will not fall from the shelves from recoil when shooting to the left. If you shoot up or down - does not fall from the shelves. (found that in the original
     Dave also decided not to fix it yet).
  3) When caching is off, the transparency mask does not work. The reason is known until corrected.

- Minuses:

  1) Bugs, bugs, bugs (already less than before, but still).
  2) ALL settings are in the .ini file.
  3) There is no illumination of a monster when hit.
  4) The initial screen saver is not the same as in the original Dave.

Changes in version 0.3 pre-beta: (June 23, 2013)

- This is the pre-beta version of the game Dangerous Dave 2: Modification Edition.
  While there is an active search for bugs and their correction.
  
- Changes:
  
  1) Completely redesigned project architecture. Global preparations for the addition of the network.
  2) Added the ability to set many Daves per level.
  3) Two types of client launch have been added: in singleplayer mode and multiplayer mode. In network mode
     login, password, address and connection port are set when the client starts. If the host or port is not specified
     assignment of a standard address, i.e. localhost.
  4) The transition to a new version of the rendering engine, which is why caching has become unnecessary, as it
     built into the engine. Caching variables are temporarily left, but disabled, if enabled, they will begin
     artifacts and the program will crash.
  5) Added a full connection to the server and synchronize monsters with it. Those. when you enter the server you will see
     all monsters, but standing still, because while Daves are not connecting to the server and, accordingly, monsters
     not processed.
  6) When the network game DD2.ini is not used, all information is received from the server, so it was entered
     file Launcher.ini, the settings in which are server-independent.
  7) Made a complete synchronization of players with the server and play on it. Monsters still do not respond
     on a player in an online game.
  8) Above each player in the network game, his nickname is now shown.
  9) As a result of testing, it was found that caching was not fully integrated into the engine, so it was
     rewritten and returned.

- Bugs fixed:
  
  1) The bug of intelligence is fixed, namely the check of "walking" on something.
  2) The animation of the door entrance has been fixed, namely its displacement by one frame.
  3) Fixed a bug of shots in a row.
  4) Fixed a bug of the new architecture, leading to a quick crash of the program.
  5) Fixed many errors and memory leaks.
  6) Fixed a bug that resulted in a server crash when closing a socket on the client side.
    
- Detected bugs:

  1) Go close to the wall to the left. Lower the gun down. Turn right. Click jump. Take off on the wall.
  2) Will not fall from the shelves from recoil when shooting to the left. If you shoot up or down - does not fall from the shelves. (found that in the original
     Dave also decided not to fix it yet).
  3) Zombie intelligence bug. Can be made to walk "through the void." If you stand on the stairs with your gun
     down - the zombies will go down half a step lower.

- Minuses:

  1) Bugs, bugs, bugs (already less than before, but still).
  2) ALL settings are in the .ini file.
  3) There is no illumination of a monster when hit.
  4) The initial screen saver is not the same as in the original Dave.
