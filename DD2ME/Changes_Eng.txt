Changes in version 0.4 pre-beta: (May 08, 2020)

- This is the pre-beta version of the game Dangerous Dave 2: Modification Edition.
  While there is an active search for bugs and their correction.
  
- Changes:
  
  1) Optimization of work with memory.
  2) Added FPS display function.
  3) The transition to a new version of the engine.
  4) Added transparency mask in modpacks. Also added the option to enable/disable it in DD2.ini.
  5) Updating the API. Now any function can be applied to any monster with a level, if you know its "key".
     The key so far can only be obtained by creating a duplicate of the monster. This gave incompatibility to scripts of previous versions
     with the current version of the API. Files in the original delivery have been overwritten.
  6) The ability to use a temporary image factory has been added to the API. Strongly improved spider intelligence in terms of
     performance.
  7) The functions onDamage () and onKill () appeared, which are called when the monster receives damage and the death of the monster, respectively.
     Additional API changes.
  8) Fixed a bug in the API associated with the crash of the program when moving by 0 pixels.
  9) Fixed a bug in the inner workings of the intelligence of monsters.

- Bugs fixed:
  
  1) Fixed a bug in the animation of Dave's death not at first when interrupting it in the previous game.
  2) Fixed all bugs found intelligence zombies. Including walking through the void and a bug with stairs.
    
- Detected bugs:

  1) Go close to the wall to the left. Lower the gun down. Turn right. Click jump. Take off on the wall.
  2) Will not fall from the shelves from recoil when shooting to the left. If you shoot up or down - does not fall from the shelves. (found that in the original
     Dave also decided not to fix it yet).
  3) When caching is off, the transparency mask does not work. The reason is known until corrected.

- Minuses:

  1) Bugs, bugs, bugs (already less than before, but still).
  2) ALL settings are in the .ini file.
  3) There is no illumination of a monster when hit.
  4) The initial screen saver is not the same as in the original Dave.

Changes in version 0.3 pre-beta: (June 23, 2013)

- This is the pre-beta version of the game Dangerous Dave 2: Modification Edition.
  While there is an active search for bugs and their correction.
  
- Changes:
  
  1) Completely redesigned project architecture. Global preparations for the addition of the network.
  2) Added the ability to set many Daves per level.
  3) Two types of client launch have been added: in singleplayer mode and multiplayer mode. In network mode
     login, password, address and connection port are set when the client starts. If the host or port is not specified
     assignment of a standard address, i.e. localhost.
  4) The transition to a new version of the rendering engine, which is why caching has become unnecessary, as it
     built into the engine. Caching variables are temporarily left, but disabled, if enabled, they will begin
     artifacts and the program will crash.
  5) Added a full connection to the server and synchronize monsters with it. Those. when you enter the server you will see
     all monsters, but standing still, because while Daves are not connecting to the server and, accordingly, monsters
     not processed.
  6) When the network game DD2.ini is not used, all information is received from the server, so it was entered
     file Launcher.ini, the settings in which are server-independent.
  7) Made a complete synchronization of players with the server and play on it. Monsters still do not respond
     on a player in an online game.
  8) Above each player in the network game, his nickname is now shown.
  9) As a result of testing, it was found that caching was not fully integrated into the engine, so it was
     rewritten and returned.

- Bugs fixed:
  
  1) The bug of intelligence is fixed, namely the check of "walking" on something.
  2) The animation of the door entrance has been fixed, namely its displacement by one frame.
  3) Fixed a bug of shots in a row.
  4) Fixed a bug of the new architecture, leading to a quick crash of the program.
  5) Fixed many errors and memory leaks.
  6) Fixed a bug that resulted in a server crash when closing a socket on the client side.
    
- Detected bugs:

  1) Go close to the wall to the left. Lower the gun down. Turn right. Click jump. Take off on the wall.
  2) Will not fall from the shelves from recoil when shooting to the left. If you shoot up or down - does not fall from the shelves. (found that in the original
     Dave also decided not to fix it yet).
  3) Zombie intelligence bug. Can be made to walk "through the void." If you stand on the stairs with your gun
     down - the zombies will go down half a step lower.

- Minuses:

  1) Bugs, bugs, bugs (already less than before, but still).
  2) ALL settings are in the .ini file.
  3) There is no illumination of a monster when hit.
  4) The initial screen saver is not the same as in the original Dave.
