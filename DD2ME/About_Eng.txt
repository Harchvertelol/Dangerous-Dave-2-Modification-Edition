I will write a little about what is. This is not really a game. Almost all parameters, and
all resources are also brought out. A folder with resources of all types is called
"Modpack". For standard Dave, the "StandartDave" modpack is used. Anyone
can create your own modpack. For example, Mario. That is, my program turns out even
some game editor. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal editor. While it is impossible
go beyond the capabilities of Dangerous Dave 2. That is, there is a walk, the choice of direction
weapons and shots. All. That is, a fundamentally different platformer is impossible to do
(but I planned to do it later). This program so far only works on the platform
Windows, but rewriting the Canvas library can achieve compatibility with any
platform, including Android and iOS. With Windows Mobile 8, my program seems to be practically
Perfectly compatible, but I have not tested.
I will sign that is already there:
1) Creating modpacks.
2) Each modpack is a collection of packs, where there is one pack of each type. Every pack
contains all the parameters and pictures of the required type.
Types of Packs:
a) BonusPacks - bonus packs.
b) DavePacks - packs of daves.
c) LevelPacks - packs of levels.
d) MonsterPacks - packs of monsters.
e) ScreenPacks - packs of screens.
f) SoundPacks - packs of sounds.
g) TexturePacks - texture packs (tiles for levels)
Sound packs are not yet supported.

It is also possible to connect your packs to modpacks.
That is, for example, to connect the texture of level tiles to the modpack of a standard dave.
Or connect your level pack.
It is also planned to make a font package and bring the intelligence of monsters to external Lua-based files.
Monsters have no intelligence yet. Also on the initial screen, the flight of the picture is not the same as in the original
Dave, since I'm a bummer. While I will not paint all the parameters of each pack, in fact there
everything is clear by the name of the variables.

Description of variables in DD2.ini:

[video]
resolutionX=320 - resolution on X
resolutionY=200 - resolution in Y
drawstep=32 - draw step. That is, once every 32 ms the screen will be redrawn. And basic event handling
animationstep=192 - step of drawing the animation.
creaturesanimationstep=64 - step to draw monster animations.
usetilecache=true - use the tile cache.
usebonuscache=true - use the bonus picture cache.
usescreencache=true - use screen cache.
usedavecache=true - use Dave's image cache.
usemonstercache=true - use the monster picture cache.
animation=true - enable/disable animation (ANY animation, that is, even monsters, deiva, tiles, so disabling
prevents the use of texture packs with traveling shelves, stakes, and so on).
tileanimation=true - enable/disable tile animation, disable does not allow does not use texturepacks with traveling
shelves, stakes and so on.
bonusanimation=true - enable/disable bonus animations.
mainscreentimefreez=10 - delay time when scrolling the main screen.
scale=2 - scaling the game window

[resources]
pooling=false - enable/disable pooling of resources. That is, the inclusion allows you to connect third-party packs to the modpack.
standart=true - whether to enable the standard modpack. When shutting down, the modpack from the modpack variable is used.
modpack=- name of modpack. Used only with standart=false.
texturepack=- name of texturepack. Used only with pooling=true.
monsterpack=- the name of monsterpack. Used only with pooling=true.
bonuspack=- name of bonuspack. Used only with pooling=true.
screenpack=- name of the screens pack. Used only with pooling=true.
soundpack=- name of the sound pack. Used only with pooling=true.
levelpack=- the name of the levelpack. Used only with pooling=true.
davepack=- the name of Dave's pack. Used only with pooling=true.

[settings]
correctionphysics=true - enable/disable physics correction. It is not recommended to disconnect.
gravity=6 - gravity force.
jumpstep=3 - the number of stages of acceleration during the fall and jump.
maxnumberoftilesforjump=3 - number of jump stages
jumpspeed=6 - shift by the number of pixels up per tick when jumping.
timedooropen=10 - time to open the door in ms.
timeexitdoor=1 - time of leaving the door in ms.
timefreezejump=1 - time of freezing in a jump in ms.
timeshoot=12 - time of one stage of a shot in ms.
realisticphysics=false - enable/disable realistic physics (in standard Dave, it is unrealistic).
distancelivemonstersX=2 - distance processing monsters at the edge of the screen in X.
distancelivemonstersY=2 - distance processing monsters at the edge of the screen in Y.
maxdistanceshoot=-1 - maximum shot processing distance (in pixels).
stepcalculateshoot=3 - step of processing the shot (in pixels). There will be no hits in monsters with sizes less than this value.

[effects]
timelivepointseffect=16 - lifetime of flying points.
changeXpointseffect=0 - change in one tick of flying points by X.
changeYpointseffect=-2 - change in one tick of flying points in Y.

[keys]
left=37 - key code for a step to the left.
right=39 - key code for a step to the right.
up=38 - key code for the up action.
down=40 - key code for the down action.
shoot=18 - key code for the shot.
jump=17 - key code for the jump.
console=192 - key code for calling the console (you can enter level NUMBER into the console - go to the NUMBER level).

[loggers]
correctionphysics=false - enable/disable logging of physics correction.

[system]
consolemode=true - start the game with/without access/access to the console
