# Dangerous Dave 2: Modification Edition
This is an open-source remake of a well-known platform game Dangerous Dave 2 with flexible and highly customizable core and many new features.
This project has a repository on the sourceforge (I created it in 2013 year), but it is currently not supported there. Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dd2moded/

# Attention
Almost all English texts in the accompanying files (documentation, readme, changes) are translated automatically, therefore, most likely, they contain any inconsistencies or incidents. If you notice something like this, then you can create issue.

# About versions
Warning: game versions 0.2 and 0.3 do not have source code and are laid out with empty source code archives. This is due to the fact that initially the project was not on the repository, and its source code was not saved from version to version.

# About project
## Done
1. Any level size.
2. Any number of monsters, things, and so on.
3. When creating a card, you can put a monster on a bonus, on leaving the door, and so on (many masks).
4. Animation of tiles + it is possible to change their type depending on the animation frame (for example, make traveling shelves).
5. All resources are taken out with parameters, which allows you to change something very simply. Support for various "packs".  
While packs are supported:
 - Texturepack
 - Monsterpack
 - Davepack
 - Levelpack
 - Sound package (not yet supported, format not ready)
 - Bonuspak
 - Screenpack
6. Flexible settings.
7. The new card format, that is, the original cards from the deiva will NOT work. But, thanks to Crazy Daver, he wrote the converter.
8. All the features of the original Dangerous Dave 2 are supported, except for the intelligence of monsters, miscalculation of a player’s shots, reload.
9. Scaling of the game window has been done (the scale variable in DD2.ini, defaults to 2).
10 The modpack has the ability to load its .ini settings file. Not particularly tested. Possible terrible bugs with a difference in values variables in the video section.
11. Added console. Press '~', switch to the MS-DOS emulator window, enter commands.

## In the plans
1. Monster generators (read "respawn points"). Needed for arena maps.
2. Network mode:
 - Cooperative
 - Deathmatch
 - Deathmatch team
 - Last Hero
 - Co-op team against monsters. Who remained in the end - won.
 - Each type will have the ability to enable and disable monsters (exception - cooperative).
3. Fix the first splash screen.
4. Add menus with text, as in the original dave.
5. Write a launcher for the interface for changing various "packs" and settings.
6. Make a compatibility check of any packs with the mod.
7. Make a port on android (this is in the distant plans).
8. Add save points directly on the map.
9. There will be no bugs of the old deiva, like shooting through a wall, going through a wall and so on.
