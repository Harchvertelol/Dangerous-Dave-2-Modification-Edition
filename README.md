# Dangerous-Dave-2-Modification-Edition
This is an open-source remake of a well-known platform game Dangerous Dave 2 with flexible and highly customizable core and many new features.
This project has a repository on the sourceforge (I created it in 2013 year), but it is currently not supported there. Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dd2moded/

# About versions
Warning: game versions 0.2 and 0.3 do not have source code and are laid out with empty source code archives. This is due to the fact that initially the project was not on the repository, and its source code was not saved from version to version.
